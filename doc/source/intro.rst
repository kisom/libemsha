Introduction

This library is an MIT-licensed compact HMAC-SHA-256 C++11 library
designed for embedded systems. It is built following the JPL `Power of
Ten <http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf>`_ rules.

This library came about as a result of a need for a standalone
SHA-256 library for an embedded system. The original goal was
to implement a wrapper around the code extracted from `RFC 6234
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234>`_; instead a standalone
implementation was decided on.
