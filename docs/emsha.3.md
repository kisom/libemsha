# Introduction

This library is an MIT-licensed compact HMAC-SHA-256 C++11 library
designed for embedded systems. It is built following the JPL Power of
Ten rules.

This library came about as a result of a need for a standalone SHA-256
library for an embedded system. The original goal was to implement a
wrapper around the code extracted from RFC 6234; instead a standalone
implementation was decided on.

# Validation

- The behaviour of this package was cross-checked using the Go 1.5.1 linux/amd64 standard library\'s
  crypto/sha256 package.
